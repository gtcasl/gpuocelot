/*
 * This application demonstrates how to use the CUDA API to use multiple GPUs.
 *
 * There's one CUDA context per thread. To use multiple CUDA contexts you
 * have to create multiple threads. One for each GPU. For optimal performance,
 * the number of CPU cores should be equal to the number of GPUs in the system.
 *
 * Creating CPU threads has a certain overhead. So, this is only worth when you
 * have a significant amount of work to do per thread. It's also recommended to
 * create a pool of threads and reuse them to avoid this overhead.
 *
 * Note that in order to detect multiple GPUs in your system you have to disable
 * SLI in the nvidia control panel. Otherwise only one GPU is visible to the 
 * application. On the other side, you can still extend your desktop to screens 
 * attached to both GPUs.
