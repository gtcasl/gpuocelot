Interactive raytracer, supporting .3ds, .ply (ascii) and .tri (binary) formats.

COMPILE/INSTALL/RUN
===================

Under Windows
-------------
Make sure you have the CUDA toolkit installed (I used version 3.2).
Then:

1. Open the cudaRenderer_vc90.sln with your Visual Studio
2. Compile in Release mode
3. Right-click on "cudaRenderer" in the Solution explorer, and select "Properties"
4. Click on "Configuration Properties/Debugging"
5. In the "Command Arguments", enter "..\3D-objects\chessboard.tri" and click OK
6. Hit Ctrl-F5 to run.

You should see a rotating chessboard... 

Read below for keyboard control intructions, or just press 'H' for help.

Note: I used the free Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition, but this should work 
with the commercial one, too.

Under Linux
-----------
(Should also work on OS/X with minor changes)

The code has 3 dependencies: You must have installed...
    - OpenGL (with GLEW and GLUT)
    - libSDL
    - CUDA toolkit 

If you are using Debian, simply...

    sudo apt-get install libglew1.5-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev

...and install the CUDA toolkit from NVIDIA (I downloaded version 3.2, 
and installed it in /opt/cuda-3.2/). After this, a simple...

    ./configure --with-cuda=/path/to/your/cudaToolkit
    make
    ./src/cudaRenderer 3D-objects/chessboard.tri

...will work.

Keyboard controls
-----------------

Use the following keys to navigate around the object:

- Hit 'H' for help.
- Hit 'R' to stop/start auto-spin (camera rotates around the object).
- Fly using the cursorKeys/A/Z. 
- Rotate the light with W/Q.
- S/F are 'strafe' left/right
- E/D are 'strafe' up/down
   (strafe keys don't work in auto-spin mode).
- F4 toggles points mode
- F5 toggles specular lighting
- F6 toggles phong normal interpolation
- F7 toggles reflections
- F8 toggles shadows
- F9 toggles anti-aliasing
- ESC quits.

MISC
====
Since it reports frame rate at the end, you can use this as a benchmark 
for CUDA cards. Just spawn with "-b" to request benchmarking:
(Note: keys don't work in benchmarking mode)

    ./src/cudaRenderer -b 150 3D-objects/chessboard.tri

This will draw 150 frames and report speed back. With my GT240, it reports:

    Rendering 150 frames in 8.117 seconds. (18.4797 fps)
