1. System Requirements

   In the long run, MCX will support most modern GPUs. However, at this
   point, MCX only has a CUDA version that is supported by nVidia graphics
   cards. In order to run MCX-CUDA, you have to make sure you have the
   right hardware and software support, this includes:

     * a CUDA enabled graphics card made by nVidia, a full list of
       supported cards can be found [10]here
     * a computer running GNU/Linux, Windows or Mac OS
     * pre-installed CUDA driver and video driver, you can download from
       [11]here

   If you plan to purchase a graphics card that can run mcx, you can
   consult the following search links:
     * [12]9800GT series ~ $100
     * [13]GTX 280 series ~ $250
     * [14]GTX 285 series ~ $300 - $400
     * [15]GTX 295 series ~ $400 - $500
     * [16]GTX 460 series ~ $150
     * [17]GTX 470 series ~ $250
     * [18]GTX 480 series ~ $400 - $500
     * [19]GTX 580 series ~ $400 - $500

   MCX performs nicely on a low-cost 8800GT card (for a given number of
   threads, MCX's speed on 8800GT is a few percent faster than the higher
   models; however, higher models allow to run more threads).

2. Running MCX

   Once you are convinced that your hardware and software support are both
   in-place, you need to setup the system environment variable in order to
   let MCX find the needed CUDA run-time library. For Linux and Mac OS
   users, you might need to add the following settings to your shell
   initialization file. Use "echo $SHELL" command to identify your shell
   type. For c-shell, i.e. csh/tcsh, add the following lines to your
   ~/.cshrc file
  if ("`uname -p`" =~ "*_64" ) then
          setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH "/usr/local/cuda/lib64"
  else
          setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH "/usr/local/cuda/lib"
  endif
  setenv PATH "/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH"

   and for "bash" or "sh" users, add
  if [[ "`uname -p`" =~ .*_64 ]]; then
          export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/cuda/lib64"
  else
          export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/cuda/lib"
  fi
  export PATH="/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH"

   to your ~/.bash_profile. If the libcudart.so file is installed in a
   non-standard folder, please replace the paths in the above scripts to
   your installation path where libcudart.so resides.

   Then, you can simply start mcx by running the executable located at
   <mcx>/bin/mcx.

   To list all supported options, you just type mcx without any
   parameters, it will print the help information.

3. Running MCX with GUI

   If you are used to graphics interfaces, you can find an executable
   mcxstudio under the same folder as mcx. [20]MCX Studio is a
   cross-platform interface to interact with MCX. It gives users a
   straightforward way to set various of parameters for a MCX session, and
   organize different sessions into projects that can be saved for later
   use. Please read [21]README to see how to use this tool to create, run
   and save the simulation sessions.

4. Compiling MCX from source code

   If you want to compile an executable on your machine from the source
   code, you should follow the steps described below:

4.1. Download the source code

   You need to first download the source code from the [22]Download page.

4.2. Install the compilers

   You need install the CUDA and C compilers on your system, this includes
     * 1. CUDA compiler and run-time libraries: this will be installed
       when you download and install the CUDA driver/sdk/tools from
       [23]this link
     * 2. GNU toolchain: you need to have gcc and make commands on your
       system. Usually
          + for Debian-based Linux users, you can get these basic
            compiling tools by a single command:
sudo apt-get install build-essential
            and then type your own password
          + for Redhat-based systems:
su -c 'yum groupinstall "Development Tools"'
            and then type the root password
          + for Windows users, you need to install [24]MinGW, a minimum
            Unix system on Windows, the [25]automatic-installer can be
            downloaded from [26]here.
          + for Mac OS users, the GNU compilers can be installed from the
            Xcode tools from [27]this link
     * 3. For Windows, you also need to install [28]Microsoft Visual C++
       200x Express Edition (or the full version; the Express edition is
       free. MCX was tested with VC++2005).

4.3. Setup paths

   For Linux/Mac OS users, you need to make sure you have followed the
   instructions to setup the paths described in the "Running MCX" section.

   For Windows, one need to add the path to nvcc (by default,
   C:\CUDA\bin), path to cl.exe (by default, C:\Program Files\Microsoft
   Visual Studio 8\VC\bin) and path to gcc/make (by default, C:\MinGW\bin)
   to your Path environment variable. You can follow the screenshots as in
   [29]this tutorial, and paste the following string at the beginning of
   the variable value field.
 C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\bin;C:\MinGW\bin;C:\CUDA\bin;

   If you have installed VC2008, you need to replace "Microsoft Visual
   Studio 8" to "Microsoft Visual Studio 9".

   If you have installed CUDA, MSVC or MinGW at a non-standard location,
   please open the Makefile under <mcx>/src to update all the
   library/include directories to the actual path.

4.4. make your binary

   For Linux/Mac OS, you need to open an terminal, "cd" to <mcx>/src, and
   type "make". This will compile MCX with the default option, i.e.
   non-atomic memory write, LL5 RNG and fast-math library. You can "cat
   Makefile" and see other options. If everything is working ok, you
   should see a binary file generated under <mcx>/bin.

   For Windows, you need to double click on a shortcut named "MSYS", a
   terminal will pop up. Then type "cd /path/to/your/mcx/src", then type
   "make". The binary will be generated as <mcx>/bin/mcx.exe.
